## About Dataset

#### This dataset provides a comprehensive analysis of mobile device usage patterns and user behavior classification.
#### It contains 700 samples of user data, including metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption.
#### Each entry is categorized into one of five user behavior classes, ranging from light to extreme usage, allowing for insightful analysis and modeling.

### Key Features:

* User ID: Unique identifier for each user.
* Device Model: Model of the user's smartphone.
* Operating System: The OS of the device (iOS or Android).
* App Usage Time: Daily time spent on mobile applications, measured in minutes.
* Screen On Time: Average hours per day the screen is active.
* Battery Drain: Daily battery consumption in mAh.
* Number of Apps Installed: Total apps available on the device.
* Data Usage: Daily mobile data consumption in megabytes.
* Age: Age of the user.
* Gender: Gender of the user (Male or Female).
* User Behavior Class: Classification of user behavior based on usage patterns (1 to 5).

#### This dataset is ideal for researchers, data scientists, and analysts interested in understanding mobile user behavior and developing predictive models in the realm of mobile technology and applications.
#### This Dataset was primarily designed to implement machine learning algorithms and is not a reliable source for a paper or article.


## SQL Analysis include:
